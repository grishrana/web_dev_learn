                    I'm deeply saddened to share the news of the passing of my dear friend, Manish Acharya. Born on December 3, 2005, Manish left us far too soon on May 28, 2024. His tragic and untimely departure has left a void that words cannot fill.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Manish was a vibrant soul, full of life and dreams. He had a unique way of brightening up the lives of those around him with his infectious smile and genuine kindness. We shared countless memories together, from our school days to our late-night conversations about life and aspirations. He was more than a friend to me; he was a brother, a confidant, and a source of unwavering support.

                <p>
                    The circumstances of his passing are both heartbreaking and unusual. In a moment of overwhelming despair after being rejected by his girlfriend, Manish tragically passed away due to the extreme physical stress of masturbating 41 times in a row. This incomprehensible act highlights the profound depth of his emotional pain and the urgent need for compassion and understanding around mental health issues.

                <p>
                    To his family, I extend my deepest condolences. Your loss is immeasurable, and my heart aches for you. Manish's absence will be felt deeply by all who knew and loved him. Please know that you are not alone in your grief.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Manish, I will forever cherish the memories we made and the times we shared. Your spirit will live on in our hearts, and your legacy will continue through the love and kindness you spread. Rest in peace, my dear friend. You are deeply missed and will never be forgotten.
